# Fitness App

See website hosted with Google Firebase here: fitness.mhiebl.com

This web app was a simple idea I had, allowing me to customise cooldowns and sets for my own workouts.

I've always disliked using my phone timer as a workout timer, and I knew I could make something simple and easy - so that's what I did.

As with most of my web apps, I have prioritised simplicity in design trying to make the use of everything feel intuitive.

I have used TailwindCSS to help make designing on the fly easier :D

## How to use

If I haven't been successful in conveying how to use the timer it works as follows:

1. Set your cooldown time and number of sets per exercise/round.
   a. If one of the predefined options isn't suitable, choose a custom value.
2. Click the "Start" button to "start" your set
3. Once you have completed the set click on "Cooldown" to begin the timer
4. Once it has completed, start your next set, and press the "Cooldown" button after finishing each set
5. Once you have finished the number of sets, click "Finish" to complete that exercise and the set counter will reset
6. Clicking reset will reset the exercise and set counters only, not the timer.
